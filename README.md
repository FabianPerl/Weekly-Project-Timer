# Weekly Project Timer

## Description
This tool uses a built-in digital timer to calculate the time spent on a project in a specified time period. 
It uses the browser's _LocalStorage_ to save every entry, __nothing goes to a backend!__
Your data remains your data! :metal:

## Features
* Add new time-entries.
* Edit existing entries with the projects name and its description.
* Remove accidently saved time-entries.
* Shows a weekly summary of created projects with its time in a doughnut chart.
* A bar chart that shows how long you have been working and how long you still have to work.
